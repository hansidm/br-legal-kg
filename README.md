## The Brazilian Legal Knowledge Graph

In this project, we use Web Semantic standards, with established legal vocabularies, to model and build an RDF-based Legal Knowledge Graph from Brazilian Federal Legislation. For this, the LexML data portal (https://www.lexml.gov.br) was used to extract relationships between laws, including citations, changes, and repeals.

List of files for this project:
- cria_arquivo_turtle - v3.py: Script to convert 'pickle' binary files into RDF format.
- rdf_graph_v3.ttl: Legal Knowledge Graph in RDF format.
